# FileManagementSystem
# This project is all about storing the data more efficiently in the local drive or even we can implement on cloud based data centres. The key point is that the file (any file format) can be stored in hard drive by occupying less space but with the same quality by using deduplication methods (for instance an image). To explain in a simply way the user will upload the file the background file processing system will generate a hash code from this file and search for similar files with same hash code in database table and if it does find one it will save this file name along the duplicate file id in database table which is file-level deduplication. If it doesnâ€™t find duplicate file then blocks of chunks are generated from this file and look for similar chunks in the database if there are any similar blocks it will store the index of those repeated blocks alongside a pattern in database table and upload unmatched blocks to local file system this is block-level deduplication, an extension to this variable boundary deduplication was used which will explained in detail in methodology. As user download the data the file will comes out as the original without any data loss. In the end we can achieve good results by saving space and minimizing I/O usage.
